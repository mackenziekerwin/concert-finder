    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>
      We use first-party cookies to remember you when you log in to our website.
      Any events you RSVP to, save, or promote are attached to your account and
      will be there if you log out and log in again. When you visit our site
      from another browser while logged in, you will not have to sign in again.
      The cookies are only used to remember events that you RSVP to, promote, or
      save to your profile. We do not store search or viewing history, nor do we
      associate that with your profile. We do not use third party cookies.

    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
      Upon registration, we store a username and password as well as any
      additional, optionally provided information such as your name and zip
      code. We do not collect any additional information about you. We allow you
      to provide a zip code for us to tailor suggested events to you based on a
      25-mile radius from your zip code. Your zip code may be changed or deleted
      at any time, and the suggested events will reflect those changes.
      “Promoted” events that are recommended to you are based only on the most
      recently promoted events by any event promoter.
    </p>
    <h3>Affiliation</h3>
    <p>
      We are not affiliated with any other services, so there is no potential
      chance for partners to receive your data through use of our service.
